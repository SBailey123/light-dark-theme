Experimenting with light and dark themes for a test site

This was one of the weekly dev challenges put forward by the scrimba platform. The original challenge let you build on their base code for a site which already had the light theme there by default.

I wanted to create the whole test site from scratch and to try implementing the toggle for the light/dark theme myself.
